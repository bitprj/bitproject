## **Introduction**

We rely on our volunteer leads to make sure an event runs smoothly for our teachers, students, and volunteers, so this role is super important but also very rewarding. In this section, we will discuss the roles and responsibilities of a volunteer lead!

We will cover specifics about BitCart and BitQuest at the very end! Hopefully before watching this video you have watched the General Event Volunteer Training Video. If not, watch it after!

## **What Volunteer Leads Do**

Our goal is to have all volunteers, especially the volunteer lead, conduct themselves in a professional manner. Events can be pretty unpredictable with things going wrong, students misbehaving, volunteers being confused or not following instructions, and many other factors. A volunteer lead’s responsibility is many things in these situations. Here is a general list of some of their responsibilities:

All Events: Volunteer Attendance, Delegating tasks to volunteers during an event, Ensuring the activity starts and ends on a timely manner, Student Discipline, Materials, End of Event Feedback

BitCart Events: Communicating with the Teachers on Methods of Control, Airtable Form

BitQuest Events: Creating a method of control and establishing ground rules, Ensuring volunteers are aware of possible troubleshooting during the event and who to contact

## **Working with Students**

In any Bit Project Event, there will be students from different academic and social backgrounds. Although it will be difficult to cater to each and every one of them, we do want to try our best to make sure all of them feel safe and have fun. A good way to do that is by always thinking about our mood, language, and delivery. All three are super important during an event in all aspects of presentation, answering questions, and discipline. Below we will go more in depth into all three subjects.

## **Mood**

Excitement is contagious. But so is seriousness, anxiety, respect, and many other emotions one can experience in the classroom. Children aren’t experts at reading micro-expressions, so a little exaggeration goes a long way! If you have something important or exciting to say, try whispering dramatically, forcing students to listen. If you want to introduce a plot twist, raise your voice. \(Ex: “Today we are going to work with paint BUT-” \*dramatic pause\* “I need all of you to listen first.”\)

This is why volunteer leads must always keep their cool. Stay calm, problem solve, move on. Everyone feeds off of each other’s energy so, the more positive vibes you spread, the more will be in the classroom.

If you need a breather that is totally okay. A classroom setting has a lot of stimuli so it is completely natural to feel overwhelmed, anxious, or suddenly drained. Sensory overload can happen to a lot of individuals, so taking a break and walking outside for a bit when you get frustrated is totally ok. Let other volunteers know it can happen and that if they need anything, to rely on you. And that relationship works vice versa- if you need anything, rely on your volunteers!

## **Verbal Language**

Language is a more general category for verbal and body language. Let’s first discuss verbal language.

Volunteer leads should always speak in a loud, slow, clear tone. This makes it seem like you know what you are doing, you know what you are talking about, and you have the authority in the room. Remember, in the classroom or during an event, you are the adult. Besides speaking loudly, slowly, and clearly, the way you say words is also important.

Enunciate your words clearly by rounding your vowels, using voice fluctuation, emphasis, and pauses to help students understand and learn certain words. Voice fluctuation is entertaining to listen to. No one likes listening to someone speak in a flat voice. Emphasize words you want students to remember. Pause when you want students to digest what you said, or to catch their attention before you say something important/give instruction.

Here are some examples you can practice with! \[You can add your own unique emphasis and pauses!\]

Tonelessly: Precipitation is another word for rain. Precipitation is a big word scientists when talking about weather.

Emphasis: Precipitation is another word for rain. It is a fancy word scientists use to describe the weather.

^^/Pauses: Precipitation is another word for rain. \*pause\* It is a fancy word scientists use to describe the weather.

Word Fun: Try placing the emphasis on different words and placing the spaces in other locations. What delivery sounds the best? Which is the worst?

## **Body Language**

Stand tall and proud. Use your height to your advantage.

When speaking, move your hands to emphasize certain words!! Being dramatic is totally cool and entertaining students follow instructions more than bored ones. It might seem comical to exaggerate everything you do, to dramatically show off the materials being used, being amazed by a student’s artwork and showing it off to the class or your peers… but it boosts their egos and students eat it up. Here are some DRAMATIC hand motions you can try in the classroom:

1. Raising both hands in the air as you shout, “WAIT!”
2. Raising a hand as you say, “BUT-”
3. Placing both hands in front of you \(like you’re calming an animal or smth\) as you whisper instructions
4. Holding a student’s work in the air and showing it off like the Lion King to the class or other volunteers.
5. “Ripping your hair out” when a student breaks a rule that YOU did NOT emphasize enough. Once you have everyone’s attention with your dramatic display, make an announcement about that rule.

## **Delivery**

Children have short attention spans, so it is important to be direct and short in your delivery. Always try to get straight to the point. Rambling makes everyone confused and clear speech can deteriorate into mumbling. If you lose sight of what you want to say, pause. There should be a strong, conscious effort to NOT use filler words such as um, uh, like, etc. There filler words can convey discomfort and anxiety to students making them either feel uncomfortable or overconfident in their ability to compromise their way out of following the rules. Show confidence!!! You got this.

## **Starting off an Event**

To do that, there are a few things that a volunteer lead should do when they are given the opportunity to begin an activity with students:

1. Introductions: First name only, and explain with exaggerated excitement \(or as if you are telling them a secret\) that you have something fun for them to do that day! \(Ex: Hello everyone! My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I am here to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\)

## **Opening an Activity**

A great opening to any activity is by asking a question you know EVERYBODY knows the answer to. For instance: What are different types of weather? What are different types of fruit? What is a bridge for?

It might seem pretty basic, but this is extremely important. Students already perceive whether they will be able to do an activity or not based on our opening introduction, so by asking a question we know they know the answer to, we inadvertently boost their confidence and their belief that they can do this activity.

## **Activity**

Troubleshooting: The activity is not going as planned.

If the activity is too hard, too easy, or progressing too quickly- volunteers will need to improvise.

* Too Hard: Simplify the activity. Identify a few key words and concepts you want students to learn and don’t worry about the rest.
  * Ie: A rocket activity may be too complex with terms like propulsion, thrust, lift, drag, aerodynamics, etc. Instead choose a word to introduce \(like Aerodynamic\) and explain the others qualitatively. \(“Something is pushing the rocket up and down”\)
* Too Easy: Introduce new vocabulary. Make challenges harder.
  * Ie: For a plant activity, students might already know what a plant needs to grow: sunlight, water, and soil. Try going more in depth on the subject matter and introducing new things like space, oxygen, competition.
* Progressing too Quickly: Add steps to the activity.
  * Ie: Paper Bridge Activity has students test their bridges once using pennies. Instead you could break the activity up into rounds using different materials to measure the strength of the bridge. Preserve the concepts but make the activity longer by introducing new challenges. 
  * Example: Round 1: 50 pennies. Round 2: 100 crayons. Round 3: Stapler.

## **Cleaning Up**

When cleaning up, identify which materials may be used again and which materials are to be thrown away. Place reusable materials back into the BitCart. Throw away other materials. Make sure you keep track of how much you used.

Try to throw away food in outdoor trash bins.

Examples of reusable Materials: LED lights, batteries

## **BitCart**

* AIRTABLE FORM: On your way back from an event, fill out and submit an airtable form in which you will fill out feedback, record materials used, and other logistical information about the event.

## **BitQuest**

* Volunteer leads have a more defined role in the event. The teacher isn’t leading the event. YOU ARE!
