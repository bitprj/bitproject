## What is the People Team?

The Bit Project has grown quickly, and plans to continue grow while maintaining our culture and remote working, embracing development, and building scalable people-oriented policies. Our team oversees recruiting and learning and development functions. We are responsible for investing in the engagement and development of members, as people, which first benefits the members, and as a result, the organization as a whole. The People team is about designing work so that you want to be there – present, engaged, and proud of what you do in Bit. In this team, we focus providing members proactive learning materials to make operations easier, especially in the times of change management. Moreover, we focus on on-boarding new members from around the United States. Please do not hesitate to reach out to any People members with questions! In the case of a conflict between the organization and a team member, the People Team is always here to assist you.
