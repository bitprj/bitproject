#### Criteria \(This is required for Video and Image Checkpoints\)

Criteria is a rubric for TA's to grade a student's Image or Video Checkpoint.

You must declare where the criteria for a checkpoint would begin. You would do this by putting the word "criteria" in a markdown h1 tag like so:

```

### Test Cases Format

**Note: All test case files must end with .test**

#### File formating

If you have multiple test cases they should have a number at the end of it like below:

**Your test case must be named after the lab/activity and then a sequential number**

* minesweeper1.test
* minesweeper2.test
* minesweeper3.test

If you have input files, then make sure that their name as .txt. **They should be in numerical order as like this**:

* input1.txt
* input2.txt
* input3.txt

#### Name

Each test case file must have a name on the first line like so:

```text
Board Function
>>> main(2)
Mines: 10
  0123456789
0 XXXXXXXXXX 0
1 XXXXXXXXXX 1
2 XXXXXXXXXX 2
3 XXXXXXXXXX 3
4 XXXXXXXXXX 4
5 XXXXXXXXXX 5
6 XXXXXXXXXX 6
7 XXXXXXXXXX 7
8 XXXXXXXXXX 8
9 XXXXXXXXXX 9
  0123456789
Enter your move (for help enter "H"): 42
Mines: 10
  0123456789
0 XXXXXXXXXX 0
1 XXXXXXXXXX 1
2 XXXXMXXXXX 2
3 XXXXXXXXXX 3
4 XXXXXXXXXX 4
5 XXXXXXXXXX 5
6 XXXXXXXXXX 6
7 XXXXXXXXXX 7
8 XXXXXXXXXX 8
9 XXXXXXXXXX 9
  0123456789
Uh oh! You blew up!
```

#### Inputs

To write test cases, you must type "&gt;&gt;&gt;" followed by the name of the function that you wish to test on. Since you will mostly be testing the main function it would look like the following:

```text
>>> main()
```

#### Outputs

Right after the declaring the function that you want to test, you would put the output right below it like so:

```text
>>> main()
Hello World!
```

#### Handling User Input

If your program needs user input, then you must include the following Python file

[https://gist.github.com/wongband/597c126217a306ca4770931680417faa](https://gist.github.com/wongband/597c126217a306ca4770931680417faa)

For the input.txt files add the input that want to put for the corresponding test file. For example, if you have input1.txt then that should correspond as the input for minesweeper1.test.

Since the minesweeper1.test lab needs to have the input of 42, all we have to do is create an input1.txt with 42 in it. **Do not put a new line if your program does not output a newline.**

```text
42
```

#### Minesweeper Example

Below is the minesweeper1.test file. In this case we target the main function while passing the number 2 to it. Below that function, the output is the board and a prompt for the user input.

```text
Create Board Function
>>> main(2)
Mines: 10
  0123456789
0 XXXXXXXXXX 0
1 XXXXXXXXXX 1
2 XXXXXXXXXX 2
3 XXXXXXXXXX 3
4 XXXXXXXXXX 4
5 XXXXXXXXXX 5
6 XXXXXXXXXX 6
7 XXXXXXXXXX 7
8 XXXXXXXXXX 8
9 XXXXXXXXXX 9
  0123456789
Enter your move (for help enter "H"): 42
Mines: 10
  0123456789
0 XXXXXXXXXX 0
1 XXXXXXXXXX 1
2 XXXXMXXXXX 2
3 XXXXXXXXXX 3
4 XXXXXXXXXX 4
5 XXXXXXXXXX 5
6 XXXXXXXXXX 6
7 XXXXXXXXXX 7
8 XXXXXXXXXX 8
9 XXXXXXXXXX 9
  0123456789
Uh oh! You blew up!
```
