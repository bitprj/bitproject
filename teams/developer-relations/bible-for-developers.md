# Bible for Developers

### General Checklist \(Applies to All Stages\)

Before going into a stage-by-stage breakdown, here's a general overview of things to keep in mind.

#### Writing Style

First and foremost, we want all our developers to use a conversational writing style when making cards. This is because the target audience for our curriculum is high school students, and our goal is to make technical education as accessible as possible. Writing as if you're having a conversation will keep students more engaged. When in doubt, think **blog post** instead of **calculus textbook**.

#### Numbering

It's crucial that each card is numbered correctly so developers can keep lessons organized and students can follow a logical progression. BitProject uses two numbering schemes, one for Activities and one for Labs.

Here's an example of an Activity \(pretty self-explanatory\):

![Numbering for Activity Cards](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-29-at-3.00.05-pm.png)

And here's an example of a Lab:

![Numbering for Lab Cards](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-29-at-3.06.54-pm.png)

Each hard card is labelled as a single number.  
Going off of the above example, **1.md is the first hard card**, and **2.md is the second hard card**.

To label medium cards, simply add another number associated with its order.  
In the above example, **1-1.md is the first medium card associated with the first hard card**, and  
**2-1.md is the first medium card associated with the second hard card**.

To label easy cards, add another number associated with its order \(3 numbers total\).  
In the above example, **1-1-1.md is the first easy card associated with the first medium card associated with the first hard card.** Can you translate 2-1-1.md into plain English?

#### Card Length

Cards should be concise. Ideally, you should not have to scroll more than once to view the whole card. Stuffing a ton of information in a single card can be too overwhelming, so try to keep things brief and split up topics as much as possible.

#### Writing Conventions

Last but certainly not least, proper writing conventions such as grammar, punctuation, capitalization, etc. should be utilized.

### Stages

Here's an in-depth breakdown of how cards progress in the BitProject system.

#### Stage 1 - Starting Content

**Card content should be accessible to beginners**, meaning someone with no prior knowledge should be able to follow the content. This goes hand-in-hand with using a conversational writing style.

Next up is what we call the **Micro to Macro Principle**. For labs and activities, please start at a micro level and then move up. For example, students should not code the main\(\) function first. As a rule of thumb, you should never have to utter the words “this function will be coded in a later part”. Every hard card should work on its own and not have to rely on later work for it to work out.

![Micro &#x2014;&amp;gt; Macro!](../../.gitbook/assets/smalltobig.jpeg)

**Images**! Make liberal use of images \(like the one above\) in your cards. It's much easier to visualize a concept than to read three paragraphs of text. Obviously, text is necessary, but pairing text with visuals is immensely helpful. Also, images help break up blocks of text, making it easier on the eyes. Please use copyright-free images, Pexels is a great source. Make sure images are embedded using &lt;img&gt; tags and not URLs.

Activities and Labs will feature coding tasks for students to complete. For these, developers should implement what we call **checkpoints**—Python console output that serves as a frame of reference for students to make sure their code is doing what it's supposed to be doing.

**Titles**. These should be included in HTML comments at the top of each card, not in the file name itself \(remember, cards are named numerically\). Along with titles, **concepts** covered in the card should also be contained in HTML comments. Here's an example:

![Titles an concepts love swimming in HTML comments.](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-30-at-9.48.40-am.png)

**Card length** should be reasonable. Ideally, keep the entire card viewable with at most one scroll.  
Students will have a hard time staying focused if a card is too long, and shorter cards are easier to digest. Try to split up topics as much as possible.

This one is pretty self-explanatory, but make sure your cards progress in a way that makes sense.

#### Stage 1 - Lab Addendum

![Not a paid endorsement, this picture just fits perfectly.](../../.gitbook/assets/inthelab.jpg)

When creating a Lab, you are essentially giving the student a problem to solve, breaking it down into steps, with each step subdivided into cards of hard, medium, and easy difficulty. An example might be to code a Python program that can solve Sudoku.

When it comes to Labs, there are a number of things to keep in mind.

**Hard cards** are, by definition, _hard._ A hard card for the Sudoku Solver Lab might explain the game of Sudoku and have a teeny-tiny bit of **starter code** at the end. Keep in mind that, although this card should stretch the student's brain, it should also provide just enough guidance for the student to finish the task. The main thing to keep in mind is you _should NOT_ leak any hints_._ Example [here](https://github.com/bitprj/curriculum/blob/master/Data-Structures-and-Algos-Topic/labs/Lab6_Sudoku_Solver/Cards/1.md).

**Medium cards** are probably the most difficult cards to make, since you have to find a delicate middle ground between hard and easy. That said, keep in mind that the goal of medium is to serve as a bridge between hard and easy. You start to squeeze out a few hint droplets into the student's cup, but don't fill the entire cup. Example [here](https://github.com/bitprj/curriculum/blob/master/Data-Structures-and-Algos-Topic/labs/Lab6_Sudoku_Solver/Cards/11.md).

**Easy cards** should literally walk the student through the problem step-by-step. Imagine leading a blindfolded person through a mine\(sweeper\) field. Functions should be completely written out, and explanations should be given for _everything._ Expanding on the juice analogy—fill the student's cup! Example [here](https://github.com/bitprj/curriculum/blob/master/Data-Structures-and-Algos-Topic/labs/Lab6_Sudoku_Solver/Cards/111.md).

It's probably a good idea to first make your hard and easy cards for a topic, then do medium last.  
That way, you give yourself boundaries that your medium card shouldn't cross.

A word about **code**. All Lab cards should contain code, with varying degrees depending on card difficulty. Make sure code is _testable_, meaning a student can copy-paste your code into an IDE and have it output something meaningtul to the problem at hand.

#### Stage 2 - Finishing Content

The bulk of your content has been finished. Here are a few more things to top off your cards.

Each card should reward the student a certain number of **gems** upon completion. Think of these as currency in a video game. Students will be able to spend gems to unlock things like hints as they progress further through curriculum tracks. Gem numbers should be included in the README file for the Activity/Lab.

![Beautiful. Just beautiful.](../../.gitbook/assets/gems.jpeg)

For each Activity and Lab, **three criteria statements** must be provided. Each criteria should outline an important takeaway from the Activity/Lab. Teachers will be referencing this criteria when grading students’ videos of Activities and Labs, and students will have to meet all criteria to proceed. The criteria can be in statement or question format and should be included in the README file for the Activity/Lab. Here's an example:

![A bucket list of things to learn for the student.](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-30-at-11.11.57-am.png)

Each Activity/Lab should contain a brief **summary** describing it using 1 sentence only. In addition, please provide a **long summary** that expands on the main concepts covered in the Activity/Lab, about 3-4 sentences total. Here's an example:

![Example of an Activity summary.](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-30-at-1.40.58-pm.png)

#### Stage 2 - Lab Addendum

For each lab, **test cases** must be provided. Make sure your lab is concise enough so that test cases can be made. For example, if you were making a Wheel of Fortune lab, don’t ask users to make their own lists of possible messages. Instead, create the messages yourself and have them simply make a list out of those predefined messages. In the scenario where students get to create their own list, it would be impossible to actually define test cases for each student’s custom list.

For the test cases, simply provide a document detailing what should be inputted and its output. There should be around 8-10 test cases per Lab.

#### Stage 3 - Finishing Touches

* [ ] Correct formatting according to READMEs
  * [ ] Modules
  * [ ] Activities
  * [ ] Labs
  * [ ] Hints \(Medium + Easy Cards\)
  * [ ] Concepts
  * [ ] Checkpoints

To define cards in an Activity, you have to have the word `cards` in a markdown `h1` tag. This is used to tell the server where the cards are:

```text
# cards
```

* **Card Key** 

Each card you define in the Activity README must have a corresponding filename as its key. For example if a card/hint was named 1.md then its key would be 1. The card key must be placed in a markdown `h2` tag like below:

```text

```text
### order
2
```

* **Card Gems**

Each card has a `gems` field. The gems fields is used to indicate the number of gems earned when opening a card. If this for a medium/easy card, this field is for the amount of gems a student would **lose** for using the medium/easy card. Each name should be in a markdown `h3` tag like below:

```text
### gems

**Name**

Every checkpoint needs a `name`:

```text
# name
Code Check in
```

**Cards Folder**

Every checkpoint needs a `cards_folder`:

```text
# cards_folder

```

**Other Fields**

* **Criteria \(Required for Video and Image Checkpoints Only\)**

Criteria correspond to a rubric for TAs to grade a student's Image or Video Checkpoint.

You must declare where the criteria for a checkpoint would begin. You would do this by putting the word `criteria` in a markdown `h1` tag like so:

```text
# criteria
```

After that you can list each criteria in a markdown `h2` tag with a number at the end like so:

```text
## criteria_1
Does the student's board look like this:
```

* **Multiple Choice \(Only for MC Checkpoints\)**

You must declare where the choices for the checkpoint would begin. You would do this by putting the words `mc_choices` in a markdown `h1` tag like so:

**Inputs**

To write test cases, you must type "&gt;&gt;&gt;" followed by the name of the function that you wish to test on. Since you will mostly be testing the main function it would look like the following:

```text
>>> main()
```

**Outputs**

Right after the declaring the function that you want to test, you would place that function's output right below it like so:

```text
>>> main()
Hello World!
```

**Handling User Input**

If your program needs user input, then you must include the following Python file:

[https://gist.github.com/wongband/597c126217a306ca4770931680417faa](https://gist.github.com/wongband/597c126217a306ca4770931680417faa)

The input.txt files should have the same numbering as the corresponding test files. For example, if you have input1.txt then that should correspond to minesweeper1.test.

If, for instance, the minesweeper1.test file needs to have the input of 42, all we have to do is to create an input1.txt with 42 in it. **Do not put a new line if your program does not output a newline.**

```text
42
```

**Minesweeper Example**

Below is the minesweeper1.test file. In this case we target the main function while passing the number 2 to it. Below that function, the output is the board and a prompt for the user input.

```text
Create Board Function
>>> main(2)
Mines: 10

5 XXXXXXXXXX 5
6 XXXXXXXXXX 6
7 XXXXXXXXXX 7
8 XXXXXXXXXX 8
9 XXXXXXXXXX 9

Enter your move (for help enter "H"): 42
Mines: 10

7 XXXXXXXXXX 7
8 XXXXXXXXXX 8
9 XXXXXXXXXX 9

> Note: Each test case file should contain 5-10 unique test cases.

#### Stage 4 - For Reviewers Only

* [ ] **Bit Learning Management System \(LMS\)**

  We have a LMS built to help us teach students step by step how to tackle complex and technical problems. In addition, we are open source so we are looking forward to finishing up LMS and creating small enough issues to let anyone contribute to our project.

For the LMS to work, each module has a folder structure to follow.

Walk through example:

On the Bit curriculum Github, there is a module you should use as an example when trying to structure your module. Follow along by going to [https://bitproject.org/curriculum](https://bitproject.org/curriculum).

Once at the link it should look like this. We’re going to go into the Data-Structures-and-Algos-Topic.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qvvB1JPKR_jm5GzbY8MyJtZ5XfJkzJiOsZTS6KswZLK_ivUf5REWuELLhDuImuoqxbSveiiCCtG8ok63KRArxcv28cCQC8ROfS2d2jkTB-9RlT7aCPOdmp95tXau3xAebj1o8VDy)

You see how each module’s names are formatted Module\# name. Please do only use dashes \(-\) between words as any colons, semicolons, and slashes \(: ; / \) will mess with Github and cause trouble.

Then into Module1-Intro-to-Data-Structures-and-Algos

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/b2jiQTcHdt07reu4h8trpAbq57cAEV5UpZfxhrImoP_a-f5mhYcUwCupfMSdX46RcXmWSZoJeQG_Ld7yauBa1ULvIhHKxcZcD5zdfn5si2XZBpvRQwkNyMV7JEn8P2-ZCNDwzQ8e)

Again, you see how activite’s names are formatted with Activity\# name and it’s title in one chunk but capitalized every first letter of each word. Please do only use dashes \(-\) between words as any colons, semicolons, and slashes \(: ; / \) will mess with Github and cause trouble.

Then into Activity1\_TimeAndSpaceComplexity

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8ErpFq3ixxWpwUZmLatNBRFG9tJYGSds9zc5YIm-fmwe76aScJzgWD89f319MnhO-kAiNNBNM8DGMISQDXVsE63gduIpm8B5Gu1ddA5pCyLRpHAm3FmSwd1lne5VKEDnO9ecWmYM)

It should look something like this:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Axm24Rp0aiNJ4PDkF9uyeIEJgFu08o2vam--oonqprZkYsvj-9DE4giGCxczXcd74hUvdtkKpyoQbwn05zOXRmK0DM4xBYsdEMY61mR9saD0Ex2mtOsWyVHacFiCgRtzjYEFEeWK)

You can already see the way that this activity is being organized. Cards, checkpoints, and images goes in their own folder. Check out each of the folders and see how things are named.

Cards are named from 1.md to \#.md.

Checkpoints are named card\#-checkpoint.md.

Images are named what the image is related to.

Notice, the most important here is the README.md. The format of readmes have been documented here [https://about.bitproject.org/teams/engineering/readme-formats](https://about.bitproject.org/teams/engineering/readme-formats). Please follow the documentation and use the example in Github as a guide. Make sure you have all the information.

\*NOTE: Gems will be explained in the next step so don’t worry about it yet.

* [ ] **Gems**

  Gems are something that students will receive upon completing a set of activities. Due to the difference in difficulty for each set of activities across all the modules, a set amount of gems does not make sense. To solve this issue, one of our members had created a Python script that you can run to calculate the number of gems that you should record in the readme of each activity.

The idea is that if you per-assign a certain number of gems to each hard card and you know the amount of mediums and easy's under that given hard card, you can use the algorithm to calculate the entirety of the gem amounts for the rest of the cards.

The script is written to assign points based on the types of cards. It’s in Python so make sure you have some sort of Python editor available for use. Download and open to follow along:  
Calculates the amount of exp to subtract from medium

**and easy cards for a single hard card \(NOT the entire lab\)**

def assignPoints\(basePts, numCards\):

```text
  # subtract the bonus
  bonusRate = 0.1
  bonus = bonusRate * basePts
  basePtsNoBonus = basePts - bonus

  # get amount to subtract for medium and easy cards
  totalWeights = numCards["medium"] + numCards["easy"] * 2
  subAmountM = basePtsNoBonus / totalWeights
  subAmountE = subAmountM * 2

  # floor amts
  subAmountM //= 1
  subAmountE //= 1
  print("Hard card: " + str(basePts))
  print("Medium card: " + str(subAmountM))
  print("Easy card: " + str(subAmountE))

  def main(): 
      numMed = int(input("Enter number of medium cards under this hard card: ")) 
      numEasy = int(input("Enter number of easy cards under this hard card: ")) 
      basePts = int(input("Enter the exp split amount for this hard card: "))

      numCards = {"medium" : numMed, "easy" : numEasy}
      assignPoints(basePts, numCards)

  n = 0 
  while (n >= 0): 
      main() 
      n -= 1
```

_Step 1:_ Open the file with a Python editor.

_Step 2:_ If you only need it once, just run the program. If you want to calculate more than once, you can change the number that the variable N \(line 30\) is assigned as. It’s set up to loop N times.

```text
                     ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MX-Beqd-BXYmCmBiTk6uFs-ZCIFyXAFP_xLaktc8kyKe3_VOtJnVHYnS8j7b917p8jns9ihDTFZJmhgXO4mQNZD0AGWtdri8dYQkxa_nRoAkMh8NvBTJdMJgFPwbfYNv3_-clbn0)
```

_Step 3:_ Enter all the inputs requested and press enter.

```text
                   ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/akLNN7ownnjpvsJm1ZmDl-gpzdHHU7WIis6DJ8RYbG0oRrmdwrm-ea-jlzJXVJ84MU3CqlUK0BnZVBEBbTrnZMzMBytgfNKGrrwA8HLg2wDEnJgKWQRYGk4iby8MT7gA3lLdxkqO)
```

_Step 4:_ With the results, please consult Kevin for the number of gems.

* [ ] **Proofreading by the Writing Team**

  This is the very last step of development. Please send your contents to the writing team \(currently Victoria Xu @@vkxu657 on Github\).

This is important to make sure all the content is syntactically and grammatically correct so students won’t have trouble with the material for maximum understanding.

It is your responsibility as a manager to raise any issues that are reported and issued to a member of your team to fix it by a deadline. All the writer’s changes should be integrated into your weekly PRs.

## Developer

For Developers, this checklist will be used to help guide them in the production of curriculum. It will serve as a checklist to help determine what a developer should or should not do when they are creating labs and activities.

For Example, as developers are doing the activity cards, there is a checklist box that states that there must be 2-3 checkpoints in the activity. By using this checklist as a guide, developers would then remember to add checkpoints somewhere in the list. This would then save the developer's reviewer's time as the reviewer would not have to ask the developer to add the missing content and wait again for the developer to implement what is missing.

## Manager

For Managers, this guide will be useful for checking on the work of the developers. Managers can refer to this checklist page to see what the developers did wrong, making giving feedback easier than ever.

For example, In the following we have Michelle as a Manager/Reviewer. In the pull request Checklist portion of this page, there is a checkbox that states "Correct Markdown Formatting", and as seen below, that checkbox was put to good use. By checking in this page, it is now easier to spot what needs to be revised, leading to faster and more efficient feedback given to the developer.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-30-at-8.51.29-pm.png)

## Kevin

This is the second layer for reviewing the curriculum. Kevin is in charge of further looking into the content of the written curriculum. Specifically, he is in charge of the pull requests made by the managers. As a result, he needs to review a lot of curriculum, and using this checklist will further help save time and work in the reviewing process.

In the following example, Kevin saw the 1 scroll per card checkbox, and therefore made the following review:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-30-at-9.54.54-pm.png)

## Daniel

Our Leader Daniel is the final layer in the review process. He Double checks what Kevin reviews and makes sure that the curriculum being used is as close to perfection as possible. And it is through this checklist that his job can be made easier as he just needs to use it as a guide to see what the other reviewers may have missed out on.
