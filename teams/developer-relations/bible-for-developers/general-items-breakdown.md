# General Items Breakdown

### General Items \(Applies to All Stages\)

* [ ] High-schooler friendly writing style, easy to understand
* [ ] Correct numbering
* [ ] Every card has code\* 
* [ ] 1 scroll per card\*\*
* [ ] Proper grammar, punctuation, capitalization, etc.
* [ ] Acceptable Styling per the Pull Request Checklist

\*Exception being hard and medium cards in labs as well as activity cards that just introduce concepts

\*\* If you have to scroll more than once to view the whole card, the card is too long

Before going into a stage-by-stage breakdown, here's a general overview of things to keep in mind.

#### Writing Style

First and foremost, we want all our developers to use a conversational writing style when making cards. This is because the target audience for our curriculum is high school students, and our goal is to make technical education as accessible as possible. Writing as if you're having a conversation will keep students more engaged. When in doubt, think **blog post** instead of **calculus textbook**.

#### Numbering

It's crucial that each card is numbered correctly so developers can keep lessons organized and students can follow a logical progression. BitProject uses two numbering schemes, one for Activities and one for Labs.

Here's an example of an Activity \(pretty self-explanatory\):

And here's an example of a Lab:

Each hard card is labelled as a single number.  
Going off of the above example, **1.md is the first hard card**, and **2.md is the second hard card**.

To label medium cards, simply add another number associated with its order.  
In the above example, **1-1.md is the first medium card associated with the first hard card**, and  
**2-1.md is the first medium card associated with the second hard card**.

To label easy cards, add another number associated with its order \(3 numbers total\).  
In the above example, **1-1-1.md is the first easy card associated with the first medium card associated with the first hard card.** Can you translate 2-1-1.md into plain English?

#### Card Length

Cards should be concise. Ideally, you should not have to scroll more than once to view the whole card. Stuffing a ton of information in a single card can be too overwhelming, so try to keep things brief and split up topics as much as possible.

#### Writing Conventions

Last but certainly not least, proper writing conventions such as grammar, punctuation, capitalization, etc. should be utilized.
