# Stage 2 Breakdown

#### Stage 2 - Finishing Content

The bulk of your content has been finished. Here are a few more things to top off your cards.

Each card should reward the student a certain number of **gems** upon completion. Think of these as currency in a video game. Students will be able to spend gems to unlock things like hints as they progress further through curriculum tracks. Gem numbers should be included in the README file for the Activity/Lab.

For each Activity and Lab, **three criteria statements** must be provided. Each criteria should outline an important takeaway from the Activity/Lab. Teachers will be referencing this criteria when grading students’ videos of Activities and Labs, and students will have to meet all criteria to proceed. The criteria can be in statement or question format and should be included in the README file for the Activity/Lab. Here's an example:

Each Activity/Lab should contain a brief **summary** describing it using 1 sentence only. In addition, please provide a **long summary** that expands on the main concepts covered in the Activity/Lab, about 3-4 sentences total. Here's an example:

#### Stage 2 - Lab Addendum

For each lab, **test cases** must be provided. Make sure your lab is concise enough so that test cases can be made. For example, if you were making a Wheel of Fortune lab, don’t ask users to make their own lists of possible messages. Instead, create the messages yourself and have them simply make a list out of those predefined messages. In the scenario where students get to create their own list, it would be impossible to actually define test cases for each student’s custom list.

For the test cases, simply provide a document detailing what should be inputted and its output. There should be around 8-10 test cases per Lab.
