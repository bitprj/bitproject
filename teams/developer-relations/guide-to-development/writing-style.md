# Writing Style

As curriculum developers it is important that everyone understand how to communicate effectively through their writing in order to keep students engaged. At Bit Project, we want our curriculum to be inviting as well as informative. Writing style should be easy to understand, but also kept professional. That being said, keep these tips in mind:

* Avoid using “I” including phrases such as:
  * “I know what you may be thinking”
  * “I want you to use your creativity to solve … ”
  * “I will now explain … ”
* Use transitional phrases when moving on to new concepts
  * “Now that you understand … Let’s move on to …”
  * You should always be making connections to what you previously learned, otherwise it becomes easy for the student to get lost in what you’re talking about!
* Use conclusional phrases at the end of cards/activities/labs when needed
* Be concise! 
  * Avoid adding unnecessary ‘fluff’ words or phrases into your sentences.
  * “So now that…” Should be: “Now that …”
* Avoid other common grammar mistakes such as:
  * Passive voice
  * Run on sentences
  * unvaried sentence structure
* Avoid repetition
  * this applies to concepts \(unless they need to be repeated\) as well as the phrases you use throughout your writing
* Avoid too much informal language
  * Although we want our curriculum to be friendly and inviting, that does not mean you can write like you’re explaining something to your friend
* Know your audience
  * At this point in the curriculum, how much do they know? How experienced are they?

Here’s an example of a paragraph with good writing style from the activity Time and Space Complexity:

“Now that we have an understanding of time complexity and space complexity and how to express them as functions of time, we can elaborate on the way we express these functions. Big-O Notation is a common way to express these functions.

Instead of using terms like Linear Time, Quadratic Time, Logarithmic Time, etc., we can write these terms in Big-O Notation. Depending on what time the function increases by, we assign it a Big-O value. Big-O notation is incredibly important because it allows us to take a more mathematical and calculated approach to understanding the way functions and algorithms grow. Let’s take a look at how we can find and use the Big-O value.”

* Notice that it flows nicely from the previously discussed concepts, and is clear and concise in what it is going to be talked about.
