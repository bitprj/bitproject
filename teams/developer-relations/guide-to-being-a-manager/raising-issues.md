# Raising Issues

## **Content**

It is each individual's job to make sure that their own code snippets are formatted and commented correctly—this is in terms of the functionality of the code. If the code works, but the spacing is off, this must be fixed by the developer themselves most likely during their second revision, but **before** merging.

1. [ ] The code is functional and devoid of runtime errors
   * [ ] If you can think of a case where the code fails, this must be addressed
2. [ ] The code uses the correct implementation
   * [ ] If the lab is about DFS, the solution should involve DFS
   * [ ] Adheres to DRY principle
3. [ ] The code uses syntax that is correct and does not contain too many "shortcuts"
   * [ ] If shortcuts are used, please make sure that this has proper syntax
   * [ ] No extraneous punctuation marks. Ex: a lot of people code primarily in C/C++/Java for school where semicolons are mandatory, if some of these show up in Python, they should be removed
4. [ ] Aesthetic and easy to read
   * [ ] Semantically named variables
   * [ ] Comments are preceded by a space. Ex: `// this is a correct comment`
   * [ ] Spaces between operators. Ex: `snake = 'Voldemort'`
   * [ ] Not `snake='Voldemort'`,  `snake ='Voldemort'`, or `snake= 'Voldemort'`
   * [ ] Has proper language selected so that there is helpful highlighting

## **Context**

### Reminders

* [ ] Are reminders given when necessary? At times we have to remind students of how an algorithm works
  * [ ] Usually at the beginning of the **first** mention in activities
  * [ ] Usually in the **medium** cards of labs

### Clear and Comprehensive Explanations

#### Methods \(overview\)

* [ ] Arguments
  * [ ] Why are those our arguments?
  * [ ] What is the expected type and data of each argument
  * [ ] Pass by reference or pass by value
* [ ] Returns
  * [ ] \(Base\) Cases
  * [ ] Explain the condition
  * [ ] Explain the return
  * [ ] Mention how we are going to return the correct value—switch cases, if else statements, recursion, etc

#### Methods \(body\)

* [ ] Conditionals
  * [ ] Explain why we check against the values that we do—is it mandated by the algorithm, the length of a list, etc
  * [ ] Explain the purpose of each conditional—is it to return the correct value, change a value, simply finding an element in a linked list, etc
  * [ ] Explain all temporary variables if used

#### Language

* [ ] Use technical terms when possible
  * [ ] The **first instances** of these in each lab/activity are bolded and followed by a reminder or an explanation
  * [ ] **Reflexive clauses** are your friends
  * [ ] If you use non technical terms \(ex: left or right\), please have them be accompanied by **more** technical terms \(ex: less than, greater than\)
  * [ ] Be careful that your tone does not become too dry—we still want to sound personable and engaging
* [ ] Adding more adjectives and adverbs do not make your explanations more clear. Just because an explanation is prefaced by "simply" or any other similar word, it does not mean that the explanation is that.
* [ ] Adding more exclamation points is borderline patronizing—babying almost. Engaging and simple introductions can be written without more than 2 exclamation points.

## **Ordering**

* [ ] Is the order of the cards relevant? You want to minimize the usage of the words "this will be discussed later"
* [ ] Is it discussed in a way where each topic builds upon on the next one?
* [ ] Is this the most common way for this thing to be explained? Can rearranging the order better explain this thing?
* [ ] Does a new card need to be created?
  * [ ] Break the card into multiple is need be
  * [ ] Break the card into more discrete steps

## **Styling**

* [ ] Markdown formatting correctly used?
  * [ ] Does it comply to the parsing requirements?
  * [ ] Are titles, bolded, code segments, code snippets, etc properly used?
* [ ] The `<img>` tag used?
* [ ] Writing is grammatically correct
* [ ] Writing is not especially wordy
* [ ] Writing can be read and understood by a 9th grader

## **Visuals**

* [ ] Images are placed in the "images" folder associated with the activity/lab/module/topic
* [ ] Images are the correct size
* [ ] Images are not copyrighted; use either stock images or custom visuals
* [ ] Visuals are not off topic and provide contextual value
* [ ] Is a screenshot of the expected format informative for students to make sure that they are on track?
* [ ] Images have a description/alternative text
