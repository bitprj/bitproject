# Guide to Being a Manager

Reviewers are in charge of **curriculum teams.** Each team consists of 4-6 people who work on different modules of curriculum. They will be tasked with a project, usually covering a topic, and a deadline. By this deadline, all activities, labs and workshops for that project should be completed.

## Starting Off: Receiving Module Assignments

All reviewers will be assigned an issue in the **bitproject** repository, to be completed within _3 days of assignment._

### Pre-approval Checklist

* [ ] Confirm modules to be done
* [ ] Finalize activities, labs and workshop list
* [ ] Confirm overall project deadline

### Post-approval Checklist

* [ ] Making Epics in a Project \[THIS SHOULD BE DONE ASAP post-approval\]
  * [ ] If applicable, make modules as Epics on Zenhub
  * [ ] Post activities, labs and workshops on Zenhub as Epics under the appropriate module
* [ ] First week's issues \[THIS SHOULD BE DONE ASAP post-approval\]
  * [ ] Generate issues that should be completed in the first week
  * [ ] Assign to a milestone for the team
  * [ ] Inform team that their milestone is ready and that it is due in a week
* [ ] Have long-term, week-by-week plan under each activity/lab/workshop Epic describing what should be done by the team each week

  * [ ] Make sure each issue is added to the appropriate Epic
* [ ] Assign Epic Points to each module, activity, lab and workshop
* [ ] Set timeline for module, activity, lab and workshop Epics in Zenhub Calendar

This checklist will be posted within the issue and should all be completed within 3 days of assignment.

## Weekly Manager Checklist

  * [ ] Ensure issues are made and set-up for next week's tasks 
  * [ ] Designate two issues _not being solved_ to be "first timer only" issues
  * [ ] Milestone should be set-up
* [ ] Adjust long-term plan and epic points for each module epic based on feedback and progress
  * [ ] Ensure General Review Checklist is being updated based on the developers' progress
* [ ] Adjust timeline in Zenhub Calendar

## Pull Request Checklist

Every week, there are a couple essential things that every manager should take care in pull requests. This checklist applies to both pull requests from developers' branches to managers' branches and from managers' branches to `master`.

* [ ] Spelling and grammar errors fixed
* [ ] Correct Markdown Formatting
* [ ] Adjust timeline in Zenhub Calendar
* [ ] Correctly spaced code snippets
* [ ] Code style followed
* [ ] Local images with &lt;img&gt; NOT Markdown 
* [ ] Splitting Up Cards \(no more than one scroll a card\)
* [ ] Readability Test: Automated Readability Index result of _9th grade or under_ \([https://readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php](https://readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php)\)
* [ ] Visuals make sense
  * [ ] Alternate text for visuals
* [ ] Specific micro-issues addressed in pull request 
* [ ] Specific "checkbox" areas addressed in pull request for each activity and lab Epic that was worked on 
  * from General Development Review Checklist
* [ ] Pull Request properly named
  * [ ] If manager: \[Module Name\] Week of \*/\*\*: \*Manager Name\*
  * [ ] If developer: \[Activity/Lab Code\] \[Activity/Lab Name\] Week of \*/\*\*: \*Reviewer Name\*
* [ ] Proper Stage Label per the General Development Review Checklist
* [ ] Proper Project Label

This checklist should be pasted into each review, and checked off completely by Sunday.

## General Development Review Checklist

The following checklist must be fully completed before an Epic deadline, and also serve as a general guide to development.

This checklist should be maintained and updated

#### The General Checklist for Devs

Developers should be developing curriculum with all of those requirements in mind. Each issue they are assigned should address items on this checklist directly.

Additionally, each pull request should have stage labels corresponding to the four stages. Please apply as many labels as applicable, for every item addressed in a stage, there should be that corresponding stage label applied.

#### The General Checklist for Reviewers

With regards to this checklist, reviewers should do the following:

* Paste this checklist into their Epic's description, and continually update it every week
* Provide _comments_ on developers' pull requests that **directly reference items on the checklist**
* In pull requests to `master`, reference stages or items that are completed
* Ensure that stage labels are being properly marked
* When entire checklist is checked off for an Epic, then that Epic should be completed and linked within a pull request to `master` to indicate completion

### General Checklist

#### General Items \(Apply to All Stages\)

* [ ] Correct numbering
* [ ] Every card has code\* 
* [ ] 1 scroll per card\*\*

## Quality Assurance Procedures for Managers and Developers

We want to the developers and the managers to provide give their input for each aspect of our projects. Therefore, we need procedures that allow the developers to quickly and effectively work together to complete tasks while maintaining a standard of quality.

### Procedure:

* [ ] Managers and Kevin conduct code reviews through GitHub
  * [ ] Checking Issues and contributions
    * Each time a developer makes a Pull Request, they need to provide a list of check boxes of items they addressed for their work that week.
    * When managers review each Pull Request, they must check to ensure that all assigned issues in the milestone were completed and the checkbox contributions match the assigned issues.
  * [ ] Every checkbox must be addressed with a comment by the reviewer
    * A comment can acknowledge that the developer did something correctly or give constructive feedback.
