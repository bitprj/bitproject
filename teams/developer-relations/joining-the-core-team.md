# Joining Developer Relations

## Introduction

In our efforts to go remote, we have established a very streamlined recruitment process for students to join our cause. Students from all over will be able to join as the onboarding process no longer requires an in-person meeting. It will utilize the following applications heavily: Zoom and GitHub.

This process involves multiple people: the applicant\(s\), managers, mentors, and more. It is expected to last about two weeks to ensure that you are smoothly integrated into one of the developer relations teams. The following list below is our breakdown of the onboarding process, assigning various tasks to certain individuals on specified dates.

## Checklist Breakdown

### Pre-Interview Tasks:

These are tasks for the manager in charge of onboarding. They are required to contact the applicant\(s\) through email once the applications are received. A zoom link is sent to them with a time and date for the Welcome Webinar. The manager is also in charge of notifying the president of Bit Project, and the applicants' prospective manager and mentor.

### Manager Tasks:

The manager is essentially the team leader of the applicant's potential team. They are in charge of making sure that you are caught up to speed with their current work and have a strong foundational understanding of the general curriculum.

#### Day 1:

The manager would first confirm that all applicants are on Slack as Slack is our main form of communication. Having everyone on one platform that has multiple communication accessories make the remote process much simpler for everyone.

An introduction is necessary so applicants are aware of who is the person they should turn to. The manager would send a greeting to the applicants, providing the following information: name, team name, position, ways to contact the manager, and the mentor. The mentor is a member of the team that is familiar with working with the manager and is comfortable with the work given. Applicants can contact the mentor whenever they are struggling and are in need of help. Mentors are essentially another source of reference that is available.

An info session will be scheduled. For now, this will be administered by another member of Bit Project until managers get settled with the new onboarding process. A more detailed explanation of the info session is provided in the Contributor Task Breakdown.

Managers will assign the member a first-timer task after the info session. These tasks vary based off of each individual team's current project. It is catered towards the project's focus.

#### Day 2-5:

Throughout these few days, the manager and mentor will be helping contributors with their first-timer task whenever needed. They would review the task once it is officially submitted and take note of any major or minor mistakes. If there are major issues, these will be communicated through Slack soon after the task is submitted. It is best to review these as soon as possible to avoid the same mistakes from reoccurring in the future.

#### Day 6:

The manager should confirm the 1:1 meeting with each applicant. This should happen before Day 14 \(the end of the onboarding process\).

#### Day 7-14:

During the scheduled one-on-one above, it will consist of a team introduction and going over the interview task and how it could be improved. The applicants may \(or may not\) go through a lab process so that they experience the structure of a lab first-hand, and at the one-on-one, they would provide feedback on the lab process.

### Contributor Tasks:

#### Day 0 \(Thursday\):

Applicants are contacted via email and are invited to attend the welcome webinar. A zoom link will already be provided within the email with a set date and time. It is important to notify us whether or not you are able to attend by responding to the email with a confirmation of attendance.

During the welcome webinar, the president of Bit Project will present to you an introduction to Bit Project and the various teams \(developer relations, engineering, people, and marketing\). Then the next step of the process is introduced where every applicant is required to join slack and create a GitHub account. Managers and mentors will give a brief introduction about themselves and welcome the applicants.

The info session time for the next day will be scheduled at the end of the webinar.

#### Day 1 \(Friday\):

On this day, applicants will attend the info session. The info session will cover the following listed topics: general breakdown of the week, onboarding presentation, introduction to the team, task explanations, GitHub/GitHub desktop set-up, activities/lab introduction, complete slack set-up, and first-timer task.

The breakdown just goes over what to expect in the upcoming week with meeting the team, new tasks, and one-on-one meetings.

The onboarding presentation will provide a brief introduction to Bit Project \(as the Welcome Webinar should have already presented this information\), GitHub & GitHub desktop tutorial, introduction to what exactly our curriculum entails with activities and labs.

Towards the end of this info session, the managers will double check that the applicants are all on slack and the team manager will provide the applicants with their first-timer task. This first-timer task is meant to introduce each applicant to the team's project, giving them an insight to how the work of a developer on this specific team. Applicants are able to refer to their mentor and team manager for help in this process.

#### Day 2-3: \(Saturday - Sunday\)

Throughout the weekend, applicants are expected to finish their first-timer task and become familiar with the use and format of issues on GitHub. Once the task is complete, the applicant will wait for their manager / reviewer to review their work.

Applicants are expected to watch the provided webinars that discuss important aspects and values of Bit Project. \(Communication, culture, etc.\)

#### Day 4 \(Monday\):

On Slack, every team manager should have a Calendly already set-up. Schedule a one-on-one meeting with your team manager.

* [ ] Schedule meeting with Manager
  * Schedule a 1:1 meeting through Calendly for Day 8-9

#### Day 5 \(Tuesday\):

On this day, applicants should focus more on the breakdown and specifics of labs and activities.

During the one-on-one, the applicant will give the manager feedback on their activity / lab experience if the applicant is given one.

Applicants are to send a greeting message into Slack, notifying their team of who they are.

#### Day 8-12:

Within these days, the applicant should be meeting with their team manager. The applicant will be taught how to take meeting notes with GitHub, and will practice taking notes throughout or after the meeting.

They will discuss the onboarding task and the manager will provide feedback. The contributor will then provide feedback on the labs and activities process \(if it is given\). Then the applicant will schedule a one-on-one with a member of onboarding. The link will be provided by the team manager.

#### Day 12-14:

The final step of the onboarding process will be completed with a one-on-one meeting between the applicant and with onboarding. Applicant will provide feedback to onboarding about the whole process, and onboarding will ensure that the applicant is ready to be fully integrated into the Bit Project team.
